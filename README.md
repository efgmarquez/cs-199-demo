# CS 199 Demo
This is the demo website of Paolo De los Santos and Ellian Marquez's CS 199 undergraduate thesis project named **"Misinformation Representation and Machine Unlearning
Mechanics in Large Language Models (LLMs)"**. In this app, we aim to give a high level overview of what our study is and what sparse crosscoders can do. This includes: steering a feature, seeing features' interpretations, analysis, and even our data.

For added interactivity, we have a **feature steering** feature in the website where you can steer a fake news-containing vector in the model's activation layers in order to ablate or strengthen fake news in the model. Interestingly, you can see how a model changes its answer based on how you control this "fake" vector

## Run local
```streamlit run streamlit_app.py``` 

Note: Since this is being run locally, the model might take a long time to load or generate answers. We recommend to change the device in the code to gpu as cpu may be extremely inefficient for transformer models like ours. 

## Study Abstract
This study investigates how misinformation is internally represented and unlearned in Large Language Models (LLMs). Using sparse crosscoders, we analyze feature dynamics across a multi-phase pipeline of contamination and unlearning using gradient ascent. We find that fake news is not encoded in isolated features, but is deeply entangled with real contentâ€”making targeted removal difficult. Despite this, crosscoders decompose entangled features into interpretable latents, enabling precise diagnosis of representational shifts. Our experiments show that gradient ascent robustly deletes harmful features: attempts to reactivate misinformation via feature steering failed. These findings support crosscoders as a diagnostic tool and gradient ascent as a durable unlearning method. This work contributes a new framework for auditing safety interventions and understanding internal knowledge structures in LLMs.
